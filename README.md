# Sleeping-Barber-Problem-CSharp-Implementation
A thread-safe implementation of the classic Sleeping Barber Problem, demonstrating concurrency control, synchronization primitives, and resource management in C# .NET.  This project serves as a practical study of Producer-Consumer patterns and Inter-process Communication (IPC) mechanisms within a multi-threaded environment.
